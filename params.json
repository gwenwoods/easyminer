Very often modelers have to stitch pieces of their custom codes or different tools by themselves.\r\n\r\nI started to think perhaps I should start to put together a project which could allow me to do data transformation, standard PMML exporting all in one tool.\r\n\r\nThis is going to be a long term project, where I can explore and play various ideas in this sandbox as well as adding new pieces to it for future uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
